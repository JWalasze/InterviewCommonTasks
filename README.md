Common programming tasks written in C# with unit tests.

The repository contains 2 projects in a solution (Console App Project and XUnit Project).

Console App -> Contains lots of small methods (most of them are extension methods) which can be seen during interview coding tasks. In the solution we can find:
- String manipulation (reverse whole sentence, reverse order of each word in the sentence, reverse order of the sentence, check if the given sentence is a palindrome, count occurrence of each letter (including whitespaces and punctuations) in the sentence, find substrings from the given sentence, remove duplications in the sentence)
- Digit operations (sum of digits from a given number)
- Fibonacci (create Fibonacci sentence)

XUnit -> Contains unit tests for methods from the app. To increase readability and clarity test methods are written using Fluent Assertions 
and naming conventions.
